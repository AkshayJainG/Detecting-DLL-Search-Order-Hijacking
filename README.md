# DLL Hijacking

#### This repository contains the following: \
**Script 1**: The script will go through each directory listed in the PATH-variable and print those directories that a user, without administrativeprivileges, can write files to. These vulnerable directories should be either remove from the PATH-variable or be audited.\
**Script 2**: This script is an extension of Script 1. This script will enable auditing on the directory in question. It will enable auditing for "Everyone" and will only audit files being written to the folder.\
